# Object Detection using Tensorflow Lite and Raspberry Pi
Machine Learning, Large Language Models, and misc.
The following was used:


*   Raspberry Pi5
*   Raspberry Pi Camera v3 *(encountered some driver issues with opencv but should work with picamera2)*
*   USB camera *(this is what I ended up using)*
*   Google Colab
