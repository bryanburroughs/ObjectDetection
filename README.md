# Object Detection using Tensorflow Lite and Raspberry Pi
<br>
<br>
** Overview **
<br>
<br>
This notebook describes the process of Supervised Machine Learning.
<br>
<br>
There are three main types of machine learning.
<br>
<br>

*   Supervised Learning
*   Unsupervised Learning
*   Reinforcement Learning

I will take 50 pictures of an object from varying angles and lighting and label these images. It can be any number of pictures but the more pictures and the more variety, the better it can learn and identify objects. This can be a very tedious process but there are some ways to speed up the process.


*   Raspberry Pi5
*   Raspberry Pi Camera v3 *(encountered some driver issues with opencv but should work with picamera2)*
*   USB camera *(this is what I ended up using)*
*   Google Colab
<br>
Below is an example of the end result if all goes well.
